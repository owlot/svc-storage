## :exclamation: Treatment of `Cargo.lock`
If you are building a non-end product like a library, include `Cargo.lock` in `.gitignore`.

If you are building an end product like a command line tool, check `Cargo.lock` to the git. 

Read more about it [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html);
